Description: This package builds on the Epimods framework which
        facilitates finding weighted subnetworks ("modules") on
        Illumina Infinium 27k arrays using the SpinGlass algorithm, as
        implemented in the iGraph package. We have created a class of
        gene centric annotations associated with p-values and effect
        sizes and scores from any researchers prior statistical results
        to find functional modules.
